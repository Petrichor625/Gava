# BHuman Observation-Inspired Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Environments

This repository contains the official implementation of  **Human Observation-Inspired Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Environments**, accepted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (ICRA) 2024.

## Highlights
- introduce a sophisticated pooling mechanism that replicates human attention allocation with a novel **adaptive visual sector**.
- Introduce a novel **dynamic traffic graph** to extract the interaction of agents using a unique **topology graph structure** constructed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).
- In benchmark tests on the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets, our model outperforms SOTA baselines by at least 15.2%, 19.4% and 12.0%, respectively, demonstrating its impressive accuracy and applicability in various traffic scenarios, including **highways** and **dense urban areas**.
